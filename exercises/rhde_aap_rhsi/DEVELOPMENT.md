# Development Doc for 'Red Hat Device Edge - Management with AAP in Advanced Networks'

This is where development of the workshop is tracked.

**Abstract:**
This lab walks participants through the act of managing Red Hat Device Edge for day 1+ activities, including application management, configuration management, etc. in challenging network conditions. The goal is to simulate a customer use case that might be transient on networks (e.g. vehicle-mounted applications), might simply not be otherwise integrated with a site’s network management (e.g. a vendor-provided appliance that connects to multiple customers’ Wi-Fi networks that the appliance has no control over), or is explicitly designed to live on a mobile network without a guaranteed fixed IP and tight control over the network (e.g. cheap LTE connections along an oil pipeline). Roll your sleeves up and learn how to seamlessly connect to these devices from Ansible Automation Platform despite the challenging network conditions through a service such as Red Hat Service Interconnect to manage the Operating System, platform, and application at scale - at the edge.
