# Red Hat Device Edge Workshop - Using RHSI in Challenging Networks

This workshop focuses on leveraging Red Hat Service Interconnect to handle connectivity in challenging networks, such as ones that do not allow connections that originate from outside the network, or where NAT is involved.

RHSI will be used to establish a connection back to a central management plane, allowing for administration of an edge device and deployment of an application.

## Presentations

The exercises are self explanatory and guide the participants through the entire lab. All concepts are explained as they are introduced.

Also, have a look at our Ansible Best Practices Deck:
[Ansible Best Practices](../../decks/ansible_best_practices.pdf)

## Time planning

The time required to do the workshops strongly depends on multiple factors: the number of participants, how familiar those are with Linux in general and how much discussions are done in between.

Having said that, this workshop is built to take roughly 2 hours.
