# Instructor Guide

## What to do During the Workshop
This workshop is self-paced, with the intention of being completed within 2 hours. The slide deck sets the stage for the workshop, then students should proceed through the exercises at their own pace.

## Checking On Workshop Services
There's a few different services involved in this workshop. They all should be up and available after provisioning, but if they need convincing use the information below. Remember to connect to the approriate node when attempting to interact with services.

To restart services, restarting the pods is safe:
```
# Restart priv pod
sudo podman pod restart workshop-rhde_aap_rhsi-priv

# Restart non-priv pod
podman pod restart workshop-rhde_aap_rhsi
```

In addition, individual containers can be restarted.

## Provisioner Notes

All instructions in the main [provisioner file](../../../provisioner/README.md) hold true, **except** this workshop uses a custom playbook over the generic `provision_lab.yml` playbook. Simply replace `provision_lab.yml` with `rhde_aap_rhsi.yml` to provision this workshop.

In terms of capacity the recommendation is to allocate 1 compute node for every 2 students.

Remember to include in the extra_vars file the hash of the ansible manifest and in the ansible-navigator.yml the reference to the correct Execution Environment (2024-02-15).

## Provisioning Ahead of Time

Expected provision time is: 90 minutes. Plan ahead accordingly. Provisioning will take longer on slower connections (ex: hotel wifi, conference wifi, etc).

## OpenShift Admin Tools

{% raw %}
The provisioner runs the OpenShift installation process from the edge-manager system. The `oc` CLI tooling will be automatically installed. The directory `/home/{{ ansible_user }}/ocp-install` will contain the kubeadmin password, kubeconfig, and installation state files/logs.
{% endraw %}
